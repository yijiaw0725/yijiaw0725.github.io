<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello World!

I am a Data Scientist at [Open House Group](https://www.openhousepm.com), where I focus on bridging the gap between messy raw data and actionable business insights. I collaborate closely with our management team to distill operational complexity into robust analytical frameworks. A recent highlight includes architecting a department-wide bonus system that synthesizes complex performance metrics into clear, audit-ready incentives. 

I am driven by identifying organizational pain points. I take the initiative to master new tools and tackle undefined problems directly. I prioritize user experience and efficiency: creating dashboards that speak for themselves, building systems that eliminate manual delays, and empowering the team to make confident decisions.

I received my Master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan and my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Virginia Tech. These studies provided me with the foundation for building interpretable models and the curiosity to always dig into the why behind the numbers. I believe that a great data scientist is also a storyteller who can unlock the hidden potential within data and turn it into a vision for the future.

In my free time, I find fulfillment in creative writing and literary analysis, where I can immerse myself in diverse perspectives and experience life through the eyes of different characters. This curiosity also extends to travel and photography, where I enjoy discovering new scenery and capturing the world through my lens. I also love strategic board games that challenge the logic and psychology behind every move.


I am always happy to connect with fellow data enthusiasts—whether to discuss analytics, literature, or potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out at `wangyijia0725 at gmail dot com`.
